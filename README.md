## Introduction

Let's upgrade the web.

## Design

### Dawn OS

Desktop OS including all the stuff needed to run Dawn network related stuff.

 * [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
 * [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
 * [Wire Guard](https://www.wireguard.io/)
 * [Zero Tier](https://www.zerotier.com/) ?
 * [Glog chain](#glog-chain) *
 * [ID chain](#id-chain) *
 * [File chain / JSON chain](#file-chain-/-json-chain) *
 * [Dawn client](#dawn-client) *

`* Optional`

### Dawn hardwares

#### Dawn R1

* 4 Cores 2.4GHz+
  * Intel atom Z3740 / AMD A8-7600
* 4GB RAM (Up to 8GB)
* 64GB SSD
* 802.11ac x2 MIMO
* Dawn OS

Designed for a low cost Glog chain master node and client.

Costs: ~ 300$ to 400$.

#### Dawn R2

* 4 Cores 2.4GHz+
  * Intel atom Z3740 / AMD A8-7600
* 4GB RAM (Up to 8GB)
* 64GB SSD + 4To HDD
* 802.11ac x2 MIMO
* Dawn OS

Designed for a low cost File chain node and client.

Costs: ~ 350$ to 450$.

#### Dawn OP1

* [Orange PI PC](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipc/) with 8GB memory.
* Dawn OS

Designed for a low cost Dawn client.

Costs: ~ 20$ to 35$.

### Network schema

![Dawn diagram 0.1](https://github.com/dawn-network/white-paper/blob/master/images/Dawn_diagram.png?raw=true)

### Blockchains

name_code: undefined

#### Exchange exchange

name_code: cypher

Blockchain offering a stack of financial services including exchange and banking.

This will be used correlates blockchain accounts value.

Work similarly as [bitshares](https://bitshares.org/).

#### Glog chain

name_code: morpheus

Cryptocurrency enabled blockchain content distribution and compensation platform.

Contain a set of posts and accounts.

 * A post contain small meta-data and a list of entries of File-chain type.
 * A post can be public or private (avaible with a key).
 * A post have a value (`pw`) in function of `vote(-100% to +100%), user_reputation, eyeball_time ?`, algorithm must still be optimized, the user must be logged to be counted and have a limited self-regenerating interaction bar `?`.
 * A post split it's value into 1+ accounts, this split occurs every X Days.
 * An account have a value and a list of transactions only visible for the account holder.

![pv/pw](https://github.com/dawn-network/white-paper/blob/master/images/curve.png?raw=true)

90% of the amount goes into content creators, 10% into entries validators.

The reward pool distribution curve of the first Glog chain over posts `pw`.

Work similarly as [Steem](https://steem.io).

#### ID chain

name_code: trinity

Blockchain that correlates blockchain addresses to enable cross-chain flows.

Work similarly as [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)

#### JSON chain / File chain

name_code: the_oracle

Cryptocurrency enabled blockchain managing ifps links, debiting/crediting accounts. Providing a ultra-secure, highly-encrypted + hashed, and 99.99999% avaible decentralized and off-chain file and data storage.

JSON chain work similarly as File chain except that files are stored in RAM and limited in size.

Work similarly as [Filecoin](http://filecoin.io/)/[Storj](https://storj.io/).

### Client applications

Client use [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/)/[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) part of [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p) to seed recent files they have viewed and for P2P communication. Providing a real-time scalable bandwith capacity.

Client interact with all blockchains.

#### Dawn client

name_code: red_pill

Interact with all blockchains, is part of the JSON / File chain for by default the file size needed by the account.

#### Dawn light client

name_code: blue_pill

Interact with all blockchains, is not part of the JSON / File chain.
